This project is an in-progress matching decompilation of Chrono Cross for PlayStation 1. The project currently targets the Japanese release (SLPS 023.64) extracted from the Chrono Cross: Radical Dreamers Edition remaster.

## Why Radical Dreamers Edition?

The original PlayStation 1 release of Chrono Cross uses complex custom disk sectoring and data packing that makes it extremely difficult to extract cleanly. Fortunately, the 2022 Radical Dreamers Edition remaster provides us with a much cleaner extraction path.

The remaster works by running an emulator that loads the original PS1 game from a file called `cdrom.dat` - which is essentially a zip file containing an unmodified copy of the original Japanese PS1 release (SLPS 023.64). The emulator then injects modern features like new fonts and artwork at runtime.

By extracting `cdrom.dat` from Radical Dreamers Edition, we get direct access to the original PS1 binary without having to deal with the nightmare of custom disk sectoring.

## Building

### Prerequisites

These instructions assume you're using a Debian-based Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.). If you're on Windows, you can use [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

### Install System Packages

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git make 7zip \
    binutils-mips-linux-gnu gcc-mips-linux-gnu \
    python3 python3-pip python3-venv
```

If on an ARM-based architecture or VM, you'll need these packages as well
```bash
sudo apt install qemu-user-static binfmt-support
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yourusername/chrono-cross-decomp.git
```

### Install Python Dependencies

We use a virtual environment to manage Python packages:

```bash
cd chrono-cross-decomp
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Important:** Each time you open a new terminal, you'll need to reactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Obtaining the ROM

You need to own a legal copy of Chrono Cross: Radical Dreamers Edition. The game is available on:
- Steam
- PlayStation 4/5
- Nintendo Switch
- Xbox

#### Extracting from Radical Dreamers Edition

**For Steam (PC):**

1. Locate your game installation directory:
    - **Windows**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\CHRONO CROSS  THE RADICAL DREAMERS EDITION\`
    - **Linux**: idk lol

2. Find the `cdrom.dat` file (in the `data` folder)

3. Copy it to the project's `disc/` directory:

```bash
# From the project root
mkdir -p disc
cp "/path/to/cdrom.dat" .
```

4. Verify the checksum:

```bash
sha1sum disc/cdrom.dat
# Should match: 354e6593b639c245ba41db1d0bd49664feb4c65e
```

**For Console Versions:**

Extracting from console versions requires additional steps beyond the scope of this README.

### Extract Game Data

Once you have the ROM in place:

```bash
make extract
```

This will extract cdrom.dat to expose all of the program data

### Build and Verify

Build the project and verify it matches the original:

```bash
make clean-check
```

If successful, you should see:
```
build/out/extracted/prog/slps_023.64: OK
```

### Additional Make Commands

- `make generate` - Split the binary into assembly only
- `make build` - Build the executable without checking
- `make check` - Compare built executable against original
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `make reset` - Wipe repository (bigger clean)
- `make generate-context` - Generate context file for m2c and decomp.me
- `make objdiff-config` - Generate objdiff configuration

## Contributing

Happily welcoming contributions! Here are some ways you can help:

### Decompiling Functions

The primary goal is to match functions - converting assembly back into C code that compiles to identical machine code.

1. **Choose a function** to work on from the `src/` directory
2. **Use [decomp.me](https://decomp.me)** to collaboratively match the function
    - Platform: PlayStation 1
    - Compiler: `gcc 2.8.1-psx + maspsx`
    - Flags: `-Wall -Wa,--aspsx-version=2.79,--expand-div -g3 -O2 -G0`
    - Source ASM copied from `asm/` directory after `make` generate commands
    - Context can be generated using `make generate-context` into `ctx/project.ctx.c`
3. Alternatively Use objdiff locally for matching
    - Call `make objdiff-config` to generate asm, objdiff.json, and context file
    - Open objdiff and point the project to the root directory
        - Preferred workflow on Windows/WSL is to run native Windows objdiff and point it to the directory in WSL
    - Explore the objects in the project viewer to find your function target
    - Run this command, replacing the paths and function name
    ```
    python ./tools/cc_decompile.py -c \ 
        ./src/slps_023.64/path/to/source.c /
        ./asm/slps_023.64/nonmatchings/path/to/source/func_01234567.s 
    ```
    - Replace the `INCLUDE_ASM()` macro in your corresponding file with the generated code as a starting point
4. **Submit a pull request** with your matched function

### Reverse Engineering

Help document and understand the game's systems:

- Join the Chrono Cross repository [Ghidra server on decomp.dev](https://ghidra.decomp.dev/) for static analysis
- Name functions, variables, and data structures in `config/symbol_addrs.*.txt` and source/header files
- Identify program layout and splits in `config/*.yaml` files
- Document game systems and algorithms
- Use emulator debuggers (PCSX Redux, no$psx) for dynamic analysis

### Tooling and Automation

Improve the build system and developer experience:

- Enhance Python scripts
- Improve objdiff/decomp.me integration
- Create Ghidra scripts for importing symbols
- Document workflows
